simple regression means we are find out a co - relation between two or more variable or features
for example - co - relation b/w exeperience and salary
creating model for that which will predict salary for particular employee exeperience
how much salary should employee get at particular exeperience

y = mx + c

y = dependent variable
x = independent variable
m = slope or coefficient positive value will increase then salary will increase
c = constant crossing to vertical axis

in salary and experience case - salary is dependent variable and experience is independent variable
here adding constant c is important because if employee have 0 years of ex means x = 0 then his salary going to be equal to constant variable

find out best fitting line in simple linear regression model
first  we subtract and then squere them and add them
we doing squere here convert negative value into positive value 

That is called ordinary least squares method

SUM(y - y^)**2  -> min value line we pick for best fitting
here is y = employee actual salary at particular year of experience
and y^ is employee model salary at same year of experience

for example - 
find out distance b/w two point in algebra (x1,y1), (x2,y2)
squere_root((y2-y1)**2 + (x2-x1)**2)

distances b/w points
5
